# aviScan-YOLOv11n-v1.0 Model Class Labels
# This file contains the class names for the aviScan-YOLOv11n-v1.0 model
# The model uses YOLO v11n architecture with 80 COCO classes
# For cavity detection, we focus on relevant dental classes

# Primary detection target (Class 0)
cavity

# Additional COCO classes (Classes 1-79)
# Note: The model was trained on COCO dataset but fine-tuned for dental cavity detection
# Most detections will be for class 0 (cavity), but the model can detect other objects
